<h2>Installing React</h2>

React is available as a node module via the <b>create-react-app</b> package that the React team has made available to us.

Follow these steps to set up React on your system.

<ul>
    <li>1. Choose an editor. I'm using Visual Studio Code.</li>
    <li>2. Create an empty directory in one of your drives.</li>
    <li>3. Open VSCode and go to the Terminal (Ctrl + `).</li>
    <li>4. First you will have to initialize npm in the directory. Run <code>npm init</code> command and follow the default instructions.
    <li>5. Then to install React you need another package called <b>create-react-app</b>. Run this command <code>npm install create-react-app --save</code>.</li>
    <li>6. To setup React run the command <code>create-react-app <app_name></code>. This will install react and the basic scaffolding you need for React. You will be able to see a directory structure appear.</li>
    <li>7. Once that is done run <code>npm start</code>. This will start React in your local browser and you will be able to see a text saying <i>You can now view <app_name> in the browser</i>. Hurray! we are done.</li>
</ul>

<i>The above directory structure is what you are supposed to have.</i>
